Sand and spray chalk machine :
The dosing device for the sand is completely reworked, the valve is now sitting down so the hardly still sand creek is there.

Sandspur thickness can be adjusted via replaceable nozzles made of POM.
Working area is Y 800mm X is limited only by the space (tested to 10m) or alternatively there are still 1500mm wide rails then Y goes to 1300mm.
Its quick change system work excellently.
 consumption will be tackled with larger can (750 ml instead of 400 ml, which also fit into the receptacle) and a modified nozzle 0.3 instead of about 0.6 mm.
The machine runs for about 3h.


Sand drawing robot

Sand drawing robot: The device takes the form of a gantry-style system that you might be familiar with from your CNC router or 3D printer. One axis is pulled back and forth with a belt drive and motor setup. The other axis, though, is different than a traditional CNC machine, as it moves across the beach using four wheels. Instead of spindle or extruder, the sliding portion simply has a hobby servo that pokes into the ground when needed, intermittently rending the sand.

The robot is effectively a long bar that acts kind of like a printer, rolling across the beach and spelling out messages by making a series of dashes in the sand. A mechanical unit slides across the main metal bar and when it gets to the spot where it needs to draw, a little notch drops down and makes a stripe in the sand.
